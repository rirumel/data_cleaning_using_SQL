# data_cleaning_using_SQL
Here, I work on cleaning a dataset using SQL. For that I used a dataset called Nashville Housing Data which is also available in the repository. I applied different cleaning techniques like: 
* Standardizing a column value 
* Split one column information into multiple columns using SUBSTRING and PARSENAME
* Dealing with null values 
* Removing duplicates using CTE
* Renaming column values using CASE statement
* Deleting unused columns from the table
