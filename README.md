# data_cleaning_using_SQL
Here, I work on cleaning a dataset using SQL. For that I used a dataset called Nashville Housing Data which is also available in the repository. I applied different cleaning techniques like standardizing a column value, split one column information into multiple columns, dealing with null values, removing duplicates and stuff like that.
